                    from Kerala and Rajib Roy, a Bengali Hindu tea plantation manager from Calcutta. When she was two, her parents divorced and she 
                    returned to Kerala with her mother and brother.[8] For some time, the family lived with Roy's maternal grandfather in Ooty, Tamil Nadu.

            <td>Roy was awarded the 1997 Booker Prize for her novel The God of Small Things. The award carried a prize of approximately US$30,000 and a citation that noted, 
                "The book keeps all the promises that it makes".Roy donated the prize money she received, as well as royalties from her book, to human rights causes. 
                Prior to the Booker, Roy won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay in 1989, for the screenplay of In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, in which she 
                captured the anguish among the students prevailing in professional institutions. In 2015, she returned the national award in protest against religious 
                intolerance and the growing violence by rightwing groups in India.
                In 2002, she won the Lannan Foundation's Cultural Freedom Award for her work "about civil societies that are adversely affected by the world's 
                most powerful governments and corporations", in order "to celebrate her life and her ongoing work in the struggle for freedom, justice and cultural 
                diversity". In 2003, she was awarded "special recognition" as a Woman of Peace at the Global Exchange Human Rights Awards in San Francisco with

                contemporary issues, The Algebra of Infinite Justice, but she declined to accept it "in protest against the Indian Government toeing the US line 
                by 'violently and ruthlessly pursuing policies of brutalisation of industrial workers, increasing militarisation and economic neo-liberalisation'".
                In November 2011, she was awarded the Norman Mailer Prize for Distinguished Writing.
                Roy was featured in the 2014 list of Time 100, the 100 most influential people in the world.</td>
